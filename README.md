## Project Overview

This Hybrid Bovine Disease Identification System is designed to assist farmers and veterinarians in the **early detection and management** of two major cattle diseases: Mastitis and Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD). By combining **text-based symptom analysis** with **image-based AI models**, the system provides **real-time, accurate diagnosis** along with **treatment recommendations**.

## Problem Statement

Cattle diseases lead to serious economic losses:

- Mastitis costs the global dairy industry **‚âà $35 billion annually**  
- FMD outbreaks can reduce milk yield by **20‚Äì50%**  
- Many small-scale farmers lack access to **timely veterinary diagnostics**  
- Traditional methods are **slow and require specialized expertise**
